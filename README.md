# Calculcate-Total-Price

Instruction
Create a program calculates the total price of items that we want to buy.

When program starts it will display the list of items, using available_parts dictionary

Then program asks to select an item

Then based on user selected item, the program checks if the item exist in the store or not. Because when quantity of item is 0 then it is out of stock

Finally, if it is not out of stock we calculate total price of items and decrease quantity from the stock. This continues until user select 0. And when the loop is terminated the total price is printed to the console
